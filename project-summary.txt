# Bomdels - Django Parts Management System Summary

## Project Overview

This Django application is a comprehensive reimagining of the Bomdels software shown in the PDF documentation. It maintains the same core functionality for managing parts in a hierarchical structure while adding:

1. User authentication and role-based permissions
2. Database storage with PostgreSQL
3. Document management
4. CSV import/export
5. Full CRUD operations on all entities
6. Activity tracking for audit purposes

## Core Components

### 1. User Management (`users` app)
- Custom user profiles with roles and permissions
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Engineer, Technician, Viewer)
- Activity logging for auditing
- User registration, login, and profile management

### 2. Parts Management (`parts` app)
- Hierarchical parts structure (parent-child relationships)
- Interactive tree view for navigating parts
- Part marking system (similar to the original Bomdels)
- Complete CRUD functionality for parts
- Search capabilities

### 3. Document Management
- Upload and associate documents with parts
- Support for multiple document types (images, PDFs, etc.)
- Document preview in the application
- Document metadata management

### 4. CSV Import/Export
- Import parts from CSV files with different update modes
- Export parts to CSV for external processing
- Import logging for tracking changes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Models
- **User Models**: Extended Django's User model with UserProfile for roles and permissions
- **Part Models**: Hierarchical structure with self-referencing foreign keys
- **Document Models**: File storage with metadata
- **Activity Models**: Tracking all user actions

### Views and Templates
- Class-based views for CRUD operations
- Function-based views for specialized operations like marking
- Responsive templates with Bootstrap integration
- Interactive JavaScript for tree view and document handling

### API Endpoints
- JSON endpoints for tree data
- Document viewing endpoints
- Marker operations

### Security Features
- Permission-based access control
- Document validation
- CSRF protection
- Secure password handling

## Extension Points

The application has been designed with extensibility in mind:

1. **Additional Document Types**: The document handler can be extended to support more file types
2. **Reporting Module**: A reporting system could be added to generate reports on parts
3. **Notifications**: Email or in-app notifications could be added
4. **Mobile App Integration**: API endpoints could be extended for mobile app use
5. **Integration with ERP/MES Systems**: The import/export functionality provides a foundation

## Deployment Considerations

- PostgreSQL database setup
- Static and media file configuration
- Environment variables for sensitive information
- Production server configuration (Nginx + Gunicorn)
- Backup strategies

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Search**: Implement Elasticsearch for more powerful search capabilities
2. **Version Control**: Add version control for parts and documents
3. **Approval Workflows**: Implement approval workflows for part changes
4. **Parts Relationships**: Add more complex relationship types beyond parent-child
5. **API Expansion**: Create a comprehensive RESTful API with authentication
